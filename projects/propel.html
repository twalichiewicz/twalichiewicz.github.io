          The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) supports a
          significant portion of the US population, with over 45.8 million
          individuals benefiting from it, roughly equivalent to 1 in 7
          Americans. This program plays a vital role in the United States, as it
          is estimated that 50% of Americans will become eligible for SNAP at
          some point during their lives. Its purpose is to provide assistance to
          low-income families by offering an average monthly food allowance of
          $250 per household.<br /><br />However, the current method of
          administering benefits on a once-per-month basis has unintended
          negative consequences on behavior, often referred to as the "windfall"
          effect. People tend to anchor their spending decisions on the balance
          they have at the beginning of the month, leading them to disregard
          future expenses. This effect is particularly pronounced when
          individuals have experienced periods of scarcity, as the sudden
          deposit of a monthly sum often results in overspending and
          misallocation of funds.<br /><br />
          Interestingly, this phenomenon affects both lottery winners and food
          stamp recipients in similar ways, the amount received regardless of
          the actual amount they receive. Regrettably, this mindset adversely
          impacts the very people SNAP aims to assist. According to the USDA,
          many families exhaust their SNAP benefits before the end of the month,
          highlighting the urgency to address the issue.

        <h4>Let’s fix this</h4>
        <p>
          Remember that "windfall" effect I talked about earlier? Well, we
          already knew that the USDA has reported that SNAP recipients have a
          hard time smoothing (spending a balance as close to 1:1 as possible)
          their spending during the month. So I wondered if we could fix this
          long-standing problem by adjusting the way that people learn what
          their balance is.

          Did we achieve our goals? Users smoothed out their spending throughout
          the month (!) Average users spent their balance three (3) days more
          slowly Propel still uses this feature in Fresh EBT to this day What
          could have gone better? Had I done a better job of selling Propel on
          more significant redesigns, I believe we may have been able to achieve
          an even larger impact with this vulnerable user base. What lessons did
          I learn? When you spend the time to empathize with your users, and
          come to truly understand their needs, even the smallest, well-designed
          changes to your product can improve their lives.
